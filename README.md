## What is Virtual Deck?
This is an iOS app called "Virtual Deck" that I developed for card game enthusiasts. The app enables users to store and organize their collection of cards virtually. Users can take pictures of their physical cards and upload them to the app. The app also allows users to create multiple decks from their collection and organize them according to their preferences.

## Why was it made?
As the final project of my mobile app development course, we were given the creative freedom to design an app of our choosing. I felt that there was a hole in the market for Virtual Deck apps and believed that I would be able to showcase the skills I learned.

## Takeaways
- **App Development:** Developed skills in IOS app development, specifically in Swift.
